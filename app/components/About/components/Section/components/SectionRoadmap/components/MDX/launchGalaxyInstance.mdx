Launch a Galaxy instance specifically configured for the needs of
eukaryotic pathogen and vector community. Carry-over and update
existing workflows from VeuPathDb Galaxy instance. In combination
with existing Galaxy best practices this will allow us to provide
users with the most up-to-date version of most common analyses
including transcriptomics (bulk and single cell RNA-seq), variant
discovery, assembly, annotation, and many other applications.
